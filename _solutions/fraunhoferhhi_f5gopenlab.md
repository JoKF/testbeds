description: The F5G OpenLab is a novel testing and experimentation facility. Its objective is to make information and communication technologies (ICT) more sustainable by promoting optical-fiber-based Fifth Generation Fixed Networks (F5G). The F5G OpenLab is located at Fraunhofer HHI in Berlin. It was created to advance the validation of technologies and solutions that were defined by the Industry Specification Group (ISG) F5G of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). F5G OpenLab aims at gathering ICT demands and promoting fiber-to-the-X technologies, solutions and standards for application in vertical industries. The F5G OpenLab is open for members from vertical industries who want to implement a digital and green business model. It provides access to the latest innovations in fiber networks. Members get the chance to access blueprint designs for networks and leverage the benefits of fiber technology for all segments. The project’s testing lab evaluates novel components, systems and network designs. It offers a vendor-neutral experimental environment and a co-working space for validating new optical and mobile network solutions with respect to their bandwidth, latency and cloud requirements.
